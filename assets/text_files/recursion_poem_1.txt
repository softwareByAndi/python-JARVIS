In the realm of code where wonders arise,
Lies a concept mysterious, where logic defies.
Recursion, they call it, a programming spell,
Unraveling the beauty in a loop as well.

Imagine a puzzle, piece by piece,
Recursive wonders, never to cease.
With elegance divine, it begins its dance,
A self-referential, mesmerizing trance.

A function profound, it calls upon,
Itself, my dear, a loop never done.
Like a mirror reflecting its own reflection,
Recursion echoes, in infinite reflection.

Through layers of calls, it travels deep,
A path unfolding, secrets to keep.
As each cycle ends, a story unfurls,
Expanding the world, breaking old rules.

Like nesting dolls, it peels away,
Solving problems large, finding the way.
From the grandest task to the simplest chore,
Recursion's embrace opens countless doors.

With recursive grace, it explores unknown,
Divides and conquers, a king on its throne.
In every step, a question taken,
Until the answer, at last, is awakened.

In dreams of algorithms, recursion shines,
Transforming mountains into gentle inclines.
No task too daunting, no challenge too great,
Recursion conquers, its power innate.

But heed this warning, with utmost care,
For recursion's beauty can lure and ensnare.
A loop unending, it can surely become,
A memory overflow, a programmer's bum.

So pray ye bold coders, wielders of art,
Tread carefully when playing this part.
With understanding and mindful stride,
Harness recursion's wonders, and let it guide.

With its enchanting dance, recursion weaves,
A tapestry of logic, where knowledge cleaves.
Let curiosity and creativity unfold,
As recursion's symphony, forever behold.
